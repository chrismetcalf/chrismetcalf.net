Currently I lead the delivery operations and support team at [Amperity](https://www.amperity.com). My team maintains most crucial process at Amperity â€“ the data pipeline through which Amperity ingests, cleans, and stitches data before delivering it back to our customers. This is our core promise, and critical to our success with our customers.

Previously, I had the pleasure of helping to grow [Socrata](https://www.socrata.com) from a small, eight person startup to a 180 person company, to be ultimately acquired by [Tyler Technologies](https://www.tylertech.com/). After joining the company as our first technical program manager, I quickly found myself filling the many roles a small startup needs help with most - leading the engineering team, supporting customers, and serving as our first sales engineer. As we helped to grow the open data movement, I evangelized transparency to governments across the country, launched dozens of our early customers, and led the re-launch of the GSA's federal Data.gov. I still know many of our early customers by first name, and count them amongst my friends.

Outside of work, I occupy myself with racing our [27 foot sailboat](http://gifthorse27.com), photography, and camping in the backcountry with my family. To keep myself sane, I participate in [GORUCK](https://www.goruck.com/the-challenge/) endurance events and sweat out my stress with [F3 Puget Sound](https://f3pugetsound.com).  I live in Seattle with my awesome wife, [kick ass dog](http://facebook.com/maggiedawg), and my adorable young son.
