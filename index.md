<p class="topline"><em>Chris Metcalf</em> is a technologist, software developer, and awkward nerd based in Seattle, Washington</p>

Chris is passionate about a lot of things. Possibly too many. Solving problems creatively using software. Helping governments and developers innovate. Teaching the curious about technology. Shipping.

He is currently the _Director of Developer Experience_ at [Socrata](https://dev.socrata.com), a fast-growing startup in Seattle that helps governments serve their constituents better through the creative use of open data.

Seven years ago, they were just a handful of engineers with a dream. Now he focuses on the developer experience, enabling civic entrepreneurs, and just generally making governments more awesome. Every single day he wakes up still a bit confused that he gets to do what he loves as a job. And they even pay him for his trouble!

Outside of work, Chris occupies himself with sailboat racing, photography, and dabbling in numerous personal projects. He lives in Seattle with his awesome wife, [kick ass dog](http://facebook.com/maggiedawg), and a couple of curmudgeonly cats.
