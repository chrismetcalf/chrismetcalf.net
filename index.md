<p class="topline">I'm technologist, software developer, and all-around nerd based in Seattle, Washington</p>

Over the last eight years I've had the pleasure of helping [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com) grow from a tiny startup to a 200 person company. A long the way, I've filled many of the roles a small startup needs help with most -- from project management and team leadership, to sales engineering, to customer support. As we helped to grow the [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) movement, I transparency to governments around the world, launched dozens of our early customers, and led the development of our core open data product. I still know many of our early customers by first name, and count them amoungst my friends and colleagues.

Now I get to serve the community I'm most passionate about - our network of civic developers - as our _Director of Developer Experience_. I create technical content, developer tools like API Foundry and our collection of libraries, SDKs, and developer samples. I've organized, mentored at, and judged dozens of [civic hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#For_a_cause_or_purpose), and spoken about open data and APIs at conferences like [API Days Paris](http://www.apidays.io/), the [API Strategy & Practice](http://apistrat.com/) series, and the [International Open Government Data Conference](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/join-the-international-open-government-data-conference-live-this-week-iogdc).

Outside of work, I occupies mself with sailboat racing, photography, and dabbling in numerous personal projects. I live in Seattle with my awesome (and understanding) wife, [kick ass dog](http://facebook.com/maggiedawg), and a couple of curmudgeonly cats.
