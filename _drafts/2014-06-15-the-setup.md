# Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Chris Metcalf](http://chrismetcalf.net), and I'm a product manager and software engineer working for [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com). For the first several years of my career, I worked for a company that [sells books and other things on the internet](http://www.amazon.com) and for the last six years (as of 2014) I've worked for [a company](http://www.socrata.com) that helps governments become more transparent to their citizens.

I consider myself a "recovering software engineer". I love the increased scope and diversity that comes from being a product and program manager, but I also love diving into detail and losing myself in code. ["Specialization is for insects"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man)

# What hardware do you use?

At work, I rock a maxed-out [13.3" MacBook Pro](http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro) from 2013, that has since been back for mainboard replacement as all MacBooks seem to need after about 13 months. After a misspent youth (read: well-spent youth) hacking [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) on a long lineage of classic IBM ThinkPads, I graduated in 2005 to my first Mac, and ignoring a few relapses, I haven't looked back. My workplace has also been nice enough to purchase me a 27" Apple Studio Display and to allow me to construct a nice standing desk.

At home I use a machine that could be best described as a late-2013 model [Mac Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPro) with about 5TB of disk. I love the extra power and space at home for doing photo and video post-processing. Since nobody other than my awesome wife can tell me to turn down my music, I have a set of [M-Audio AV 40](http://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-Studiophile-Active-Monitor-Speakers/dp/B0051WAM64/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402896831&sr=8-1&keywords=m-audio+monitors)s on either side of my old 24" LCD on my custom homebuilt standing desk.

I also have an [iPhone 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5) and a non-Retina [iPad Mini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipad_mini). The iPhone is in a [grey MagPul case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2JICKC/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I've burned through several [Otterbox Commuter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2JICKC/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) cases, but I welcome the slim protection of the MagPul case. The iPad lives in a [Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Ultrathin-Keyboard-Folio-iPad/dp/B00EXK1L38/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402896073&sr=8-1&keywords=logitech+bluetooth+keyboard+folio)

My mobile devices all cuddle together in a black-on-black [Timbuk2 Commuter](http://www.timbuk2.com/commute-tsa-ipad-laptop-messenger-bag/269.html) bag with a custom [Baileyworks](http://www.baileyworks.com/)-style strap I built myself from parts at [Seattle Fabrics](http://seattlefabrics.com/). I love being able to cinch my bag down tight but still be able to swing it around to access things quickly. At some point I'll document my strap in a blog post.

For photography, I have a [Nikon D300s](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-12-3MP-DX-Format-Digital-3-0-Inch/dp/B002JCSV6M). My go-to lenses are the [Nikkor 50mm f/1.4](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/5014af.htm), the [10-24mm f/3.5-4.5](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-24mm.htm), and "black beauty", my [Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/80200.htm). For "daily carry", I love my [Lumix DMC-LX3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CCLBSA/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I've yet to purchase a proper action cam, but I've got a knock-off GoPro that I make good use of.
