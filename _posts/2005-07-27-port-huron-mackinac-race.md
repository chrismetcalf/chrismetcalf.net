<p>This past weekend I got the chance to go back to Michigan and race with some old (and new) friends on the Mumm 36 "Vanguard."<br />
<br />
Great race. Extremely fast and relatively uneventful besides a few dozen sail changes. Many a record was shattered this year. I beat my personal best by about 10 hours by finishing at 3AM on Monday morning.</p>
I've set up a Flickr <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/sets/651631/">photoset</a> with my photos from Boat Night and the island.
