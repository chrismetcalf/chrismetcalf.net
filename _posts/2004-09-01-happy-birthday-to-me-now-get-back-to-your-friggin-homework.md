Wow, almost a month since I last posted to this thing. I really shouldn't let it slip this much anymore.

Well, as of about 20 minutes ago I'm 23 years old. Well, I guess technically I'm not 23 until about 8:00am, but right now I really don't care.

I'm finally all settled in at Carnegie Mellon, and we started class Monday. The crush has already hit. After spending about 7 hours in the "cave" (more on that later)  doing other homeworks, I've headed home to clear my head before starting a one-page writeup on a case study thats due tomorrow morning.

I've never been much of a coffee drinker. Too much of it does strange things to my head. But now I'm realizing just how important it will be for my survival in this program.

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> This post should be read in more of a cynical tone... I'm not as angry or depressed as it may have sounded. I was pretty damn tired and stressed at the time. I'm not (nearly) as tired or stressed now...
