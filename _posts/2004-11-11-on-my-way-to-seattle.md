I'm on my way to Seattle right now. Well, not quite yet, but I'm sitting in Pittsburgh airport waiting to board. They've got free wireless now. Good stuff.
I did get TSA'ed though. Big Quadruple-S Sweepstakes Winner!

A nice man named Robert patted me down, but he didn't give me his number afterwards.
Overall it wasn't all that bad of an experience, but it does kind of shake you up a bit. I'm pretty careful about not packing anything bad, but there is that "Shit, what if I DO have something?" moment. Basically they just make you wait in line forever, check your bags for bomb residue before searching them, and make sure you aren't metallic.
