So, I thought I was really bright a few days ago at Fred Meyer, picking up supplies to fix stuff around my apartment. A flapper valve for my running toilet, some gaskets for a dripping faucet, and a can of "[Plumb Away](http://www.amazon.com/Plumb-Away-Second-Aerosol-Drain-Opener-Refill/dp/B0002BD17Q)" to clear out a slow-running bathroom sink.
Little did I know what I was getting myself into...

Of _course_ I followed the instructions. I filled the sink with water, covered the backup drain with a wet rag, and pushed downwards on the can as if it were a plunger to force my pesky plug out of my plumbing.
And then my world exploded.
I live in an older apartment building. Older as in probably about 60-70 years old. Which means I have about 50-60 years of crud built up in my plumbing. All that crud, with the exception of the crud actually clogging the sink, chose exactly that moment to leave my plumbing. And exit promptly all over my bathroom. 
As it seems, the extra large backup drain of my sink also provided an extra large exit for said crud, all of which promptly forced its way out past my carefully placed rag, and all over my bathroom. Covering my sink, my shower, my walls, and even myself. No innocent bystanders were spared.
The results? I was left with:
* A bathroom covered in crap that was older than me
* A sink fully of lemony fresh fizzy water
* A drain that is still completely plugged
And, while wiser for the experience, I'm still $9 poorer, and I still don't have a completely working sink.
