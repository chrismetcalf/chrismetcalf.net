So its been brought to my attention that the formatting of my wiki pages breaks if you use an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">inferior browser</a>. I'm working on it...
In the meantime, upgrade to a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">real browser</a>, or just don't go there :)
