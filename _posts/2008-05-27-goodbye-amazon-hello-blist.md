After 2 years, 7 months, and 7 days at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com), I've decided to make a major career change.
May 16th was my last day at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com). After about a week of a half of vacation I'm starting all over today at [blist.com](http://www.blist.com), a small, early-stage startup in Pioneer Square, Seattle. My tentative job title is "Technical Project Manager", but my actual work will encompass so much more. I'm looking forward to working with such a young, ambitious company and getting the chance to leverage my skills and experience in ways that will hopefully help make them very successful.

In my tenure at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com), I had the opportunity to work with so many awesome people that I can't count how many people I need to thank. I still love [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) and all it's hard working employees, but this opportunity at [blist](http://www.blist.com) was too good to pass up. They're small, scrappy, and have a grand vision of the future, probably much like Amazon did when it was starting out. It's a big jump, but it should be a great ride, and I look forward to being able to accomplish some great things.
