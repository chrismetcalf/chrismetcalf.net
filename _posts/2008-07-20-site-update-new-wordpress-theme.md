Since I was just about sick of my old blog theme, I spent some time this weekend and worked up a new one.

<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2687796196_e24cf1802b_b.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Lady Liberty"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2687796196_e24cf1802b_m.jpg" alt="Lady Liberty" /></a>

It's heavily based on <a href="http://tarskitheme.com/">Tarski</a>, with a few local tweaks. Tarski worked out great as a base, and I highly recommend it.
