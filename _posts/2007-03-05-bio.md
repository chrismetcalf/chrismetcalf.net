# Hello.
This is [chrismetcalf.net](), and I'm, obviously, Chris Metcalf. Here I blog about my life, technology, making stuff, and anything else that I happen to find interesting.

# About Chris Metcalf
Chris was born in upstate New York, and spent his childhood in the small rural town of [Owego, NY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owego_%28village%29%2C_New_York). He spent his formative years in front of a 386 exploring [BBS]()'s and generally trying to find ways to abuse to his parents' phone bills.
After stints in a couple of other states, Chris found himself attending high school in [Troy, MI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_Michigan), just outside of Detroit. By then he'd traded in the BBS phone lists for IRC chat rooms, HTML, and a stack of [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com) Linux install floppies. Slackware was later traded for [Redhat](http://www.redhat.com), and eventually [BeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS).
In 2000, Chris enrolled at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu), and was thrown headlong into the world of C++ programming and hash tables and red/black trees. By then, Be had gone out of business and he'd settled in nicely with [Debian](http://www.debian.org). After 4 years of the usual college hijinks, including an 8 month adventure working for [IBM](http://www.ibm.com) in California, he earned his bachelor's degree in [Computer Science Engineering](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/).
Michigan was followed up by a whirlwind 12 months of graduate school at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) in Pittsburgh, PA. C++ was traded in for process management, software architecture, and risk management. Here Chris received his [Masters of Science in Information Technology - Software Engineering](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msit-se/).
Chris then relocated to Seattle, WA to work for [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com), a small e-commerce website that sells books and such, as a Software Engineer. After a year or so he found himself as a Senior Software Engineer, and when he finally discovered that he was spending more time telling other engineers what to do and how to do it, he became a team lead and eventually a Technical Project Manager. 
After 2 years, 7 months, and 7 days at Amazon, he moved on to [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com), a small startup just down the street, to become a Technical Program Manager. Depending on the day of the week, the phase of the moon, and how much coffee he had to drink in the morning, Chris can be found hacking around with Ruby code, performing system administration, experimenting with new web technologies, chasing down bugs, or actually even managing projects.
Outside of his professional life, Chris enjoys [racing sailboats](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/11290903/), [skiing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/129201068/), and [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/74056255/). Recently he's taken up [surfing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/234659017/), but in reality the ocean wants to kill him and has successfully prevented him from becoming all that good at it. He has also fallen deeply in love with his [Apple MacBook Pro](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/268362716/) and Apple TV, and could probably be considered a fanboy.
