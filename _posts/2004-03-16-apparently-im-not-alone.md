So I did a simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=AT%26T+T226+Problem&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&start=0&sa=N">Google search</a> and discovered a number of other people complaining about similar problems.
Of significant interest is <a href="http://216.239.37.104/search?q=cache:_8K_4YxbwAUJ:awscs.lithium.com/attws/board/message%3Fboard.id%3Dsonyericsson%26message.id%3D8572+AT%26T+T226+Problem&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">this thread</a>. Thats a Google cached version of <a href="http://awscs.lithium.com/attws/board/message?board.id=sonyericsson&message.id=8572">this link</a>, which has since been <em>deleted</em>. Obviously AT&T doesn't seem to like to admit that people are having problems with this "upgrade".
Gizmodo also has a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/attsony_ericsson_phone_replacement_sms.php">posting</a> about the matter. Most notibly is this statement:<blockquote>As part of the new 850MHz GSM upgrade that is going on in many of their markets, AT&T has decided to proactively send out the T226 in markets where it feels the new phone will provide a "better experience" than the T68.</blockquote>
So in reality, the upgrade was AT&T's decision, not Sony's.
I've found a <a href="http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/03012004051751AMEBRE48.htm">just</a>   <a href="http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/03082004091614AMEBRJR7.htm">a</a>  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5326780577844212/">few</a> other bloggers complaining about AT&T's practices. It seems that AT&T continued to sell incompatable 1900mhz phones while rolling  out their 850mhz network, and are just now cleaning up their mess.
And people wonder why AT&T was hemoraging customers and had to merge with Cingular. 
<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> If you want to read the rest of that AT&T forum thread, this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Alithium.com+%22Free+T226+Upgrade%22&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Google search</a> should allow you to get to the cache of all the messages.
<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> I found <a href="http://awscs.lithium.com/attws/board/message?board.id=sonyericsson&message.id=9748">another thread</a> on their listserve. It sounds like some people have been getting upgraded to T616's on an individual basis. Why has their phone support not been notified about this?
