Today a friend and I decided to do some digging and see how far back we could find references to ourselves on the Internet

I found a few good ones:

<ul>

	<li>1997 - <a href="http://216.239.39.104/search?q=cache:oLLbyr8NiisJ:cerebus.winsite.com/archives/1997/thrd5.html+%22chris+metcalf%22+laser&amp;hl=en&amp;start=7">Posting to a Laser class mailing list (Google cache)</a> - an archive of a mailing list I used to be on.</li>

	<li>1998 - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981203145809/http://floach.pimpin.net/">floach.pimpin.net</a> - a <a href="http://www.waybackmachine.org/">WayBackMachine</a> snapshot of a Windows "shell replacement" news site I was a co-maintainer of for a few years.</li>

</ul>

I only wish I could remember the URL's of my old webpages so I could look them up.
