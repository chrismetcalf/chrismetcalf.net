I'm sorry if you don't get the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a> reference. Great movie, really...
Over at <a href="http://www.thebroken.org">thebroken.org</a>, Kevin Rose has an interview with <a href="http://www.kevinmitnick.com/">Kevin Mitnick</a> in their latest episode on what life was like for him in federal prision.
Best lesson: When the big guy asks for your shoes, don't give them up. Get your ass kicked instead. You'll be thankful.
