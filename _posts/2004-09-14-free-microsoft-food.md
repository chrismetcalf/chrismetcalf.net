You might have heard that Bill Gates <a href="http://www.tcpulse.com/2004/09/14/news/gatescenter/">just donated 20 million dollars</a> to the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science to build what will now be called the "Gates Center for Computer Science."

We'll all be gone long before the building is completed, but that sure as hell didn't stop us from snagging our share of the free food Microsoft provided this afternoon. I've come to realize grad school is all about snagging as much free food as possible. $15,000/term in tuition and all it takes is some free cheese and crackers to make us happy.

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> I've posted some pictures of the spread that they set up for the Microsoft celebration. It was quite impressive. In the second picture you can find me if you look hard enough:
