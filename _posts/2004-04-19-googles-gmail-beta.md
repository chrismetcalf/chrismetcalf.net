Clay Wood, an alumni from Eta Kappa Nu, was cool enough to hook me (and a bunch of other Michigan EECS kids) up with invitations to Google's new (and controversial) "GMail" service.

As an experiment, I'll be forwarding all my mail there and be using it as my primary email client. I'll blog about my experience for those people that haven't been lucky enough to get an account. Note the new "GMail" category on the right.

So far, it looks <em>very</em> cool.
