This one's a pretty short one. I wanted some tripod leg pads for the Gitzo Basalt Reporter tripod I picked up used (and got a great deal on) but I didn't feel like paying over $40 for [a set from](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/481450-REG/LensCoat_LCG3530BK_LegCoat_Tripod_Leg_Protectors.html) B&H. So I made my own.

Read below for more instructions.

They're really simple. Basically I just started with some foam rubber pre-slit pipe insulation from Home Depot:

And then I stitched up some ballistic Cordura covers with velcro from some leftover material I had:

Super simple, and I think the results are better than the ones for sale.
