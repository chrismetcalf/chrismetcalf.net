Well, it looks like the boys and girls at <a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a> may have made some changes to their RSS feeds that break my <a href="/blog/archives/2005/01/03/delicious-plugin-for-wordpress/">plugin</a>.

So I've taken it offline for awhile, and I'll figure out whats wrong with it when I've got some more free time. You've been warned.
