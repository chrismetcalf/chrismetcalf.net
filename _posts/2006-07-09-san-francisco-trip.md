4th of July weekend I headed down to San Francisco to meet up with my friends and fellow cavemates for a pretend "reunion" of sorts. Most of my graduating class from my masters program showed up and it was an absolute blast. Plenty of alcohol was consumed, stories were retold, and new memories were made.

I also took a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/sets/72157594190180830/">whole ton of pictures</a> for those who are interested in that sort of thing.
