Today I was the first casualty of the coming robot-human war. While watching one of the final rounds of the <a href="http://www.grandchallenge.org">DARPA Grand Challenge</a>, I was taking photos leaning on one of the concrete barriers that surrounded the track. After leaving the tunnel section of the course, "Tommy", <a href="http://www.teamjefferson.com/">Team Jefferson</a>'s entry, rapidly accelerated to about 40 miles per hour and struck the barrier exactly where I was standing. I had just enough time to run a few steps and dive into the dirt as it hit the barrier and knocked it about four feet towards where I was standing. Fortunately I escaped with a few cuts and scrapes from my dive, but Tommy was totaled.
<strong>Update:</strong> Talking to Team Jefferson later that day I found out that the last reading from their telemetry data had them going in excess of 50 miles per hour. However, they worked non-stop all night and had their vehicle ready for one more attempt the next day.
