For some reason I thought I'd share a few pictures I posted to Flickr of my new apartment.
I've spent the last couple months accumulating new furniture and I'm pretty happy with the results. The crown jewel was a great brown leather couch I picked up on Craigslist last weekend that really pulls the whole thing together. And I got a great deal on it.
