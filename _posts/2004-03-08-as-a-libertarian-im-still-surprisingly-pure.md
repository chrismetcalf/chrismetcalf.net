So I just took the <a href="http://www.bcaplan.com/cgi/purity.cgi">Libertarian Purity Test</a>... and it appears I'm not nearly as libertarian as I thought...
<blockquote>31-50 points: Your libertarian credentials are obvious. Doubtlessly you will become more extreme as time goes on.</blockquote>
Thats out of 100 points. I think the distinction comes with "little-l" vs. "big-L" libertarians. I'm not nearly anarchist enough to be a "little-l" yet...
