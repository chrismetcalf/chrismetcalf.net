I'm probably asking for another title wave of invite requests, but I need to get rid of these things somehow.

I just started using Gmail again recently and I've got 5 invites sitting around doing anything. If you've somehow escaped getting a Gmail invite, leave me a convincing comment describing why you need a Gmail account.

However, <em>do not</em> email me asking me for an invite. I'm training Gmail to recognize emails begging for invites as spam. If you want an invite, comment, don't email.
