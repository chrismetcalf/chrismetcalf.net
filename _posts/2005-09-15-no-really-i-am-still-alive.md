My plan to blog my way through Europe really didn't work out the way I'd originally planned. I have, however, been posting lots of photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/">Flickr</a> if you've been watching that.

I head home in 2 days and I promise some posts and stories when I get home if not earlier.
