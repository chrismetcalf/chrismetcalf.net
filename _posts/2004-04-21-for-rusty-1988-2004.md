Today we had to say goodbye to a loyal friend.

Today we had to put one of our family's favorite pets to sleep. As he approached the ripe old age of 16, age had simply taken too much of a toll on him. He had a long, full life of deer and bunny chasing, and we're all sure he's much happier now.

I decided I'd blog the occasion to make sure I always remembered him. The most loyal of friends deserve that.
