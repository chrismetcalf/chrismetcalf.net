Apparently I'm a productivity guru now:

<blockquote>"I really need to spend a day sitting down doing the Chris Metcalf lifehacks thing, and organizing all my projects into folders and such..." - A friend of a friend in a forwarded email.</blockquote>

Whenever people take an interest in the nerdy little hacks I post, I'm quite surprised and flattered. So I've decided to start posting more Lifehacks. If this kind of stuff interests you, <em>please</em> leave me a comment and let me know how you feel.

So stay tuned for more fun hacks.

<strong>Update:</strong> By the way, I'm not the only desperate, productivity-challenged geek out there doing this stuff. By no means did I start this, I'm just another hipster with a stack of 3x5 cards. There are lots of other great resources for Lifehacks and Lifehacks-compatible ideas:

<ul>

    <li><a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43folders</a> - Merlin didn't start it all, but he sure has done a good job of bringing lots of good ideas together. The site is a bit Mac-bigoted, but then again everybody is these days. Also home to a great <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com">wiki</a> where a lot of folks have posted great ideas.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> - Way too many ads, but the RSS feed leaves those out. Lifehacker tends to aggregate ideas from a lot of other sites so its a good one to watch for ideas.</li>

    <li><a href="http://michaelhyatt.blogs.com/workingsmart/">Working Smart</a> - A great productivity blog for managers or wanna-be-managers.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.slackermanager.com/slacker_manager/">Slacker Manager</a> - Also with a management focus, but a little more easy-going.</li>

    <li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> - Surprisingly, there are a lot of good <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/43folders/">tags</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/hipsterpda/">with</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/indexcards/">some</a> great <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lifehacks/">Lifehacks</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/gtd/">GTD</a>-compatible ideas.</li>

</ul>

Oh, and pick up a copy of David Allen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000280/qid=1114839305/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-6173057-9952928?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Getting Things Done</a>. Right now.
