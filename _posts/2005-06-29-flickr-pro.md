Well, I finally took the leap and signed up for a Flickr Pro account. So expect to see me posting a lot more photos now that I don't have to worry about the upload cap and I can actually organize them.
If you haven't noticed yet, I added a sidebar on the left side that shows my last five Flickr photo postings. You can also go check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/">Flickr homepage</a>.
