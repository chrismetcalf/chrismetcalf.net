By popular request, I thought I'd write this one up. It's a quickie.

A month or two ago, I was lucky enough to spot a pair of very cool vintage theater seats with a big "FREE!" sign on them sitting on them down the street from my apartment. After my eyes lit up with the possibilities, I convinced an anonymous neighbor to help me haul them to the elevator. 
Then I asked my awesome father for some carpentry assistance, since I can't fit a table saw in my apartment.
He totally came through for me with a great "floorboard" made from some gorgeous teak/holly flooring (commonly found in sailboats) edged in oak. Mounting it to the seats was pretty straightforward - just some 10-24 stainless bolts backed by fender washers and nylock nuts. I added some standoffs made from nail-on nylon "magic mover" pads to make them easy to move around.
The result is awesome. They work great as a couple of extra seats for guests that stay out of the way when I'm not using them. And I love the quizzical look friends get on their faces when they try to figure out how I managed to steal them from the movie theater.
