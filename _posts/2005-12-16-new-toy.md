Earlier this week I got an awesome new toy... A <a href="http://www.pauck.de/marco/photo/stuff/peleng_fisheye/peleng_fisheye.html">Peleng 3.5/8mm fisheye lens</a> for my D100. You can take some really fun shots with it and I've created a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/sets/1590019/">Flickr set</a> for all my fisheye work.
