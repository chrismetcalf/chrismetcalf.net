Yes. You heard me correctly. Its snowing in Seattle. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, go directly home and start stockpiling boxes of granola.

In all honesty this should be interesting. Apparently nobody in Seattle knows how to drive in the snow, and they have no snow removal equipment. At 1PM, with no snow accumulation, they sent all the kids home early from school. Employees who commute a long way have already started leaving to work from home. We've been warned against coming into work tomorrow if we don't have to.

I'll try and get pictures when I head home.
