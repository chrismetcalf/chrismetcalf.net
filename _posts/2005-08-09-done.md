Yes. That there about sums it up. I'm done. Done with my Masters degree. Probably done with my college career for awhile.
Its a weird feeling. I celebrated it by coming back to my apartment and packing for about six hours. And now I'm celebrating with a nice rum and tonic. Still strange though. I had to run some errands around Oakland and I was assaulted by visions of "college life". Students sitting on porches with acoustic guitars and beers on a Monday night. I'll miss college.
Well, here's to what's next!
