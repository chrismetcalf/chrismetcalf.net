For the last 4 hours or so I've been doing something I haven't taken the time to do for months... read a book.

My father gave me a copy of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765307154/002-2060552-7974423?v=glance">The Last Jihad</a>, by Joel C. Rosenberg. I'm halfway through and I've already concluded that this is <em>the most Republican work of fiction ever written</em>.

After the first few pages, its already set up quite the Republican fantasy: A Republican elected by a landslide after W's second term, strong economy, massive tax cuts, America safe from terrorism while those crazy Europeans are still getting their butts kicked...

As a book, it fits the mold of books I really enjoy reading. Techno-thriller, lots of guns, secret missions, and all that James Bond jazz.

But there have been more than a few "hey wait a second!" moments in the first half of the book. Like the fact that they seem pretty serious about the whole "nuke Iraq" plan, and a pretty unabashed endorsement of the <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/carnivore/">Carnivore program</a>. Some of them are pretty funny, while the rest of them make you want to shake your head. Theres nothing wrong with writing for a target audience, but this reads like a Bill O'Reilly fiction novel.

But hell, it must be good, since I've been reading it non-stop for 4 hours.
