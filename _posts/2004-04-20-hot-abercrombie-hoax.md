If you've been watching <a href="http://www.blogdex.net">Blogdex</a> over the last few months, you've probably noticed that one person always seems to be ranked very highly. <a href="http://amandadoerty.blogspot.com/">"Hot Abercrombie Chick"</a>, aka Amanda Doerty.

However, according to <a href="http://overstated.net/04/04/19-hot-abercrombie-hoax.asp">overstated.net</a>:

<blockquote>Just received an inside tip that the recently famous Hot Abercrombie Chick is really a male college student capitalizing on cute pictures of his girlfriend (previously unbeknownst to her) in a rush of "beggars" trackbacks. In retrospect, it's pretty obvious that he is quite the player. Over the course of the last couple of months, "Mr. Abercrombie" has played every text-book trick for raising his popularity on the blogosphere.</blockquote>

Hah! I knew it. She was too good to be true. And nobody that hot sits in front of a computer doing nothing but commenting (often tastefully and correctly) on other peoples blogs.

And some people seem to be trying to <a href="http://blogdex.net/track.asp?id=8795950">fight back</a>...

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> Aw, what the hell. I'll join the blogdex slam campaign against her:  <a href="http://amandadoerty.blogspot.com/">Comment Spamming Bitch Riding High On Blogdex!</a>
