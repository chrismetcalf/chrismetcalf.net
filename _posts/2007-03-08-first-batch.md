For months I've been talking about brewing my own beer. I bought my brewpot, I started making up beer names, deciding what styles to try, but I never bit the bullet and went for it.

Well, this weekend, I finally did. Steph and I stopped by <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=mSt&amp;q=bob%27s+homebrew&amp;near=Seattle,+WA&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=47606389,-122330833,16942314332359042997&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=authority">Bob's Homebrew Supply</a> and picked up a homebrew kit on Saturday, and on Sunday afternoon we whipped up our first batch. I can't compliment Bob enough on his service. Every homebrew enthusiast I've talked to (which is starting to seem like one out of every three Seattle natives) has eschewed the virtues of Bob and his homebrew shop, and they're all true.

For $125 you get a starter kit which includes everything but the brewpot (that kit runs $189, which is also a great deal and includes a case of bottles) along with all the ingredients for your first batch. Bob is enthusiastic, friendly, and knowledgeable. When disasters strike in the brewing process, its a comfort to know you can always call for "tech support". His shop is clean and his selection is great, but I'm surprised to find that he doesn't have a website.
For my first batch I decided to brew a standard IPA. Although I know it won't be perfect, it should be a good beer to start with. The brewing process is a bit more complicated than I expected, but I've had a blast so far. Watching my beer grow and bubble is pretty fun.
I'll keep posting updates as things progress, and I'll be sure to post an update about how the beer turns out.
