Well, I've decided its about time I start my own business. I've done some small jobs, done plenty of development for other people, and hacked around for countless hours on my own pages. As such, I've officially opened the doors of <a href="http://poppinfresh.net">poppinfresh industries</a>. I've been using the company name "poppinfresh industries" on web forms since I was 12 years old, so I decided I'd stick with it. I like it, its catchy.

So if you need some web design, administration, or custom software development, give me a shot. I'm cheap.

Now all I need is customers.
