The <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~sailum/">UofM Sailing Team</a> was featured in the "Sports Monday" edition of todays <a href="http://www.michigandaily.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/04/19/408406783c5ae">Michigan Daily</a>:
<blockquote>You may have seen him at the last Festifall.
No, it wasn't the guy with the Michigan crew shirt on, holding up a huge oar and a sign saying, "Big, strong athletes wanted here."
It was the other guy. The one with the 5-foot sailing boom - quite a bit smaller than a crew oar = and a sign reading, "Small athlete? Try Michigan Sailing."
This was the tactic of fifth-year senior Craig Capilla, along with other members of the Michigan sailing team, used last September to reel in new recruits.</blockquote>
Yeah. Craig kicks ass.
