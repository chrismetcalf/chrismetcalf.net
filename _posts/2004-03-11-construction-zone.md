We finally convince our landlord to fix our bathroom so it no longer drains into our kitchen, but that means we have to put up with a week of construction as they build us a new bathroom.
And there's nothing nearly as fun as waking up at 9AM to the sound of Zacki's henchmen chipping the tile off the wall in the bathroom down the hall with an air-powered chisel.
