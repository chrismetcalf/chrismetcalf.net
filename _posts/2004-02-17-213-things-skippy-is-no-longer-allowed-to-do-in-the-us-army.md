This list is awesome. You really have to check it out: <a href="http://kewlstuff.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$2236">The 213 Things Skippy is No Longer Allowed to Do in the U.S. Army</a>:

<blockquote><a href="http://kewlstuff.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$2236">The MP checkpoint is not an Imperial Stormtrooper roadblock, so I should not tell them "You don't need to see my identification, these are not the droids you are looking for."</a></blockquote>

And even better:

<blockquote><a href="http://kewlstuff.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$2236">The Chicken and Rice MRE is *not* a personal lubricant. (Skippy wanted this noted for the record that this is not something he has ever attempted or considered! It was something we heard at dinner on 22 September 2001 and it was just so obscene it had to go here.)</a></blockquote>
