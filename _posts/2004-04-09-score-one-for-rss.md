I finally got around to setting up <a href="http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/">Feed on Feeds</a>. Its a great server-side RSS aggregator. I've got it set up on my webhost so I can log in from anywhere and catch up on all my favorite <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS</a> feeds.

You really don't grasp the true value of RSS until you've got a good feed aggregator. I've got it set as my Firefox homepage now, and theres nothing like being able to glance through 40 or 50 feeds and see whats been updated in the last 15 minutes, and then scan quickly through the latest entries to see if there is anything new worth checking out. I can watch 50 sites with the same effort it used to take me to just read <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.
