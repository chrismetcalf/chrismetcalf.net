<a href="http://jbyers.com/">James Byers</a>, a sailing friend of mine who also happens to be quite the successful techie, tipped me off to his new startup project: <a href="http://www.whoat.com">WhoAt</a>.
Yes... it is in fact YASNP (Yet-Another-Social-Networking-Project). But this one has an interesting twist that might make it pretty cool... it's location aware.
So the theory is that when you hit the coffee shop with your PowerBook (or ThinkPad), you can let the network know where you are and it will alert you to possible new friends in your vicinity. You can then learn more about them or send them messages. You can also use the service from your mobile phone using SMS or a WAP browser (the phone interface is <em>very</em> simple, I was impressed).
Right now the service only covers NYC and San Francisco, but James said he'd be adding San Jose to the list within a week or so.
