Well, I had a hectic final two weeks of the semester followed by a my one week long "summer break."

I had planned to post a whole bunch of things over break but it appears I took a vacation from my blog as well... I've got lots of ideas for new content so I should have plenty I can post over the next week or so.

In other news, I graduate on Sunday. I gradaute, but I'm not done yet. Carnegie Mellon's kind of funny like that. I get to walk but I don't get my diploma until August after I finish the rest of my classes.
