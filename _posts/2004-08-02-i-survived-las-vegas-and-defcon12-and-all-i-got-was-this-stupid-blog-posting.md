Well, my trip to Las Vegas was successful. Although I didn't cover the cost of my trip with my gambling winnings (the only gambling I did was playing slots for free beer), I did have a kick ass time.

Instead of doing the tourist thing with the girls, a few of us snuck off to <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-12/dc-12-index.html">Defcon 12</a>, the annual (and controversial) computer security convention. Some of the highlights included:

<ul>

	<li><a href="/uploads/essid-ads.png">Vendor ads</a> via 802.11b</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://www.shmoo.com">Shmoo Group</a>'s <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4508373394872473/">Sniper Yagi</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7166397862995041/">WiFi Bug</a></li>

	<li>BlueSnarfing and <a href="http://agentsmith.salzburgresearch.at/agentsmith_projects_bluebug.html">BlueBugging</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.doxpara.com/">Dan Kaminsky</a> doing shots during his TCP/IP Black Ops talk (and unveiling Voice over DNS)</li>

</ul>

Amazingly, both my laptop and I survived the whole affair. I connected to the warzone that is the Defcon network without being cracked or landing on the <a href="http://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=2197">Wall of Sheep</a>. However, I did get portscanned at least 4 times and somebody even attempted to crack me via Bluetooth. I'd like to thank SSH and iptables for keeping me safely encrypted and happily firewalled.

I've got a whole bunch of notes I took down in a wiki while I was at the convention. I'll get them up as soon as possible.
