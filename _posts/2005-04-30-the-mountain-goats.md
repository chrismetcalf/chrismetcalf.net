<a href="http://mountain-goats.com"><img class="floatleft" src='/uploads/dilaudid.jpg' alt='Dilaudid EP' /></a> <a href="http://mountain-goats.com/">The Mountain Goats</a> new EP, <em>Dilaudid</em>, is available for <a href="http://www.4ad.com/frameset.html?/news/&0">digital download</a> in DRM-free AAC or MP3 format for about $5.72 (3 GBP).
A great album for a great price. We really should encourage this method of distribution, so I encourage you to go check it out.
It also includes "This Year," which is a <em>freaking awesome</em> song. Go get it. Now.
