I did some surfing this afternoon (Thursdays are my easy day) and found some other good reflections on Tuesday's election:

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://harpers.org/ElectingToLeave.html">Harper's Magazine</a> has more information on how to immigrate to Canada.</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/11/4/141510/460">Daily Kos</a> seems to think that because Bush wasn't elected by a landslide he doesn't have any authority.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">John Kerry's address</a> on his website is actually very good. Thank you very much for not being a bitter loser. You will be respected for it.</li>

	<li><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2109079/">William Saletan</a> on Slate gives the Democrats some advice - stop being so complicated. I agree. But I doubt anybody will ever be able to unite the thousands of different agendas that is the Left into one coherent message.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2004/11/blackfives_vote.html">BlackFive</a> and his story about nearly being "disenfranchised." Please note that he is a Republican.</li>

</ul>
