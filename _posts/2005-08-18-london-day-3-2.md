Three days and I'm exhausted already. I've done most of the standard touristy London things... the British Museum, the National Gallery, double-decker bus tour, etc. I even took the ferry up to Greenwich and stood on the Prime Meridian.

I'm staying in the Generator Hostel in London, a gigantic 800-bed hostel with its own bar, internet cafe, and cafeteria. Also the cheapest pint in London, and they know how to put on a good party.

Tomorrow I'm flying over to Dublin to meet up with a friend of a friend for the weekend. I'll be racing in the Etchells Irish Nationals and then their European Championship.
