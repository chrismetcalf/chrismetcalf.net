Last night I went to see Michael Moore's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>.

Its a good thing Laura took me out for pizza & beer afterwards to cool me off.
I have serious issues with the style of Michael Moore's "documentaries" (yes, I've also seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/">Bowling for Columbine</a>) . For one, I don't think they even come close to qualifying as documentaries. They're more like two-hour long Michael Moore opinion columns.
Here's his modus operandi:
<ol>
	<li>Present a few well known "facts" (many of which have not even been proven true), things that have been highlighted in the major news media for weeks or months or years</li>
	<li>Make some very tenuous connections between his "facts", using mainly rumor or conjecture</li>
	<li>Before the viewers have the chance to come to their own conclusions about what they've just seen, bombard them with hyper-emotional imagery in an attempt to make them automatically come to the same conclusions Moore has come to himself.</li>
</ol>
And that's how he continues for the duration of the movie. Even worse, he has this coddling tone that makes it sound like he's talking to a child. If you're trying to make a documentary meant for self-thinking, intelligent adults, you don't talk down to them like they were infants.
So suffice to say I didn't buy into his ruse. The imagery he used was very powerful. He showed a lot of film that many people would feel shouldn't be shown, including a lot of bloody pictures of civilian casualties and even the Fallujah killings of the civilian security contractors. Personally I feel that in another context they shouldn't have been shown. But Moore's goal was to be controversial and edgy, and he succeeded.
But that doesn't mean I have to like it.
