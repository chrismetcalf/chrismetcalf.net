I've started a <a href="/wiki/index.php/SanJoseWirelessCafes">page</a> in my <a href="/wiki/">wiki</a> where I'll be posting all the coffe shops and similar establishments I find around downtown San Jose that have free wireless internet access.
After spending 4 years in Ann Arbor where there are 3 coffee shops per corner and they all have free wireless, it was a bit of a shock to find out the rest of the world wasn't the same. This is Silicon Valley... I expected there to be free WiFi on every corner!
