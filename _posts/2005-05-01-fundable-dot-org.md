I thought I'd take a minute to plug my friend's new startup, a project that I think has a lot of potential and that could be very cool if it takes off.
<a href="http://www.fundable.org">Fundable.org</a>. Its a very neat idea. Say, for instance, that you've got a project you'd like to undertake which requires buy-in from a large number of individuals. Something like having a web designer create a good looking webpage for an open-source project or bringing a decent band to a musical vacuum like Pittsburgh.
Fundable allows you to create a "group action" that people can contribute money towards. Say it'll take $1000 to get <a href="http://www.thelongwinters.com">The Long Winters</a> to make a stop in Pittsburgh during their next tour:
<ol>
    <li>Create a group action with a goal of getting them to play here in Pittsburgh.</li>
    <li>Allow the advance purchase of 100 tickets to the show for $10 apiece.</li>
    <li>If the group action gets 100 people to contribute, the $1000 is "turned on" and the group leader can then withdraw the money and set up the show.</li>
    <li>If the action doesn't get enough contributors, everybody's money gets refunded.</li>
</ol>
Its a neat concept and I think it could be great for setting up "bounties" for open-source projects or for starting advertising campaigns for non-profit groups.
So go <a href="http://www.fundable.org">check them out</a> and let me know what you think.
