As is traditional every couple of years, I've grown sick of my old blog template and created a new one. Except this time, I've gone out on a limb and dumped [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) in favor of it's relatively unknown distant non-blood-related cousin, [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto). No more cruft, just pure hacker-friendly blogging.
