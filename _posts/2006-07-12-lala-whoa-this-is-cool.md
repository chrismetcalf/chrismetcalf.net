So a week or so ago I discovered <a href="http://lala.com/">lala</a>. It may just be the simplest and best dotcom idea I've seen in a long time.

I have CDs. You have CDs. In all honesty, I'm sick of most of my CDs. And you probably are too. I might not have listened to my Nirvana "In Utero" CD in 8 years, but maybe you've recently suffered a bit of nostalgia and you want to listen to them again. So why don't we trade?

Within a half hour or so of me having my beta account I loaded a bunch of the CD's that I knew I had into my "I Have" section and I'd added a bunch of CD's I wanted to my "I Want" section. About an hour or two later I discovered that I'd had my first match and that somebody wanted my copy of The Clash's "London Calling" (an excellent CD by the way). And simultaneously somebody was shipping me Jurassic 5's "Quality Control". And I was only out $1.

Too cool.

<strong>Update:</strong> If anybody wants lala invites, add a comment below and leave the email address you want it sent to. I have a bunch.
