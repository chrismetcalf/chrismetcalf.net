Every "maker" (crafty person who makes stuff, in the sense of "Make" magazine) needs a good place to store their supplies and tools. Especially if they live in a 600 square foot studio apartment like me.

This is mine. [Click through](http://flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/2177649620/in/set-72157603662780580/) to Flickr to see the details of all the stuff I crammed into it. It started as a standard IKEA shelving unit that I decided to convert into storage, but when I discovered that they had discontinued the cabinet (and more importantly the doors) I bought the last set of doors they had and painted them flat black.

The final results (if you don't look too close) are quite nice and fit in well with the rest of my apartment (and effectively hide my toys).

In a future post I'll detail my "workshop" (slash office) as well.
