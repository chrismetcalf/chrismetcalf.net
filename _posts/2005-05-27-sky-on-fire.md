<p>We had a nice big thunderstorm today in Pittsburgh, and just after the thunderheads moved by the sky opened up a little and you could see the sunset.<br />
<br />
I sprinted out of my apartment up the street to where I could see more of the sky. It only lasted a few minutes, but I managed to get it.<br />
