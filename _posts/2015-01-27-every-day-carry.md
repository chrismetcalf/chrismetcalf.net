Time to out myself. I've recently been fascinated by the "EDC community" (no, it is not an offshoot of the "seduction community"), and I finally decided to do [a pocket dump](http://everydaycarry.com/posts/4428/Just-Another-Day#) for [Everyday Carry](http://everydaycarry.com).

<div class="everyday-carry-embed"><iframe style="border: 0;width: 852px;height: 448px;" scrolling="no" src="http://everydaycarry.com/posts/4428?embed=frame&view=compact"></iframe></div>

A few notes on some items beyond what [I posted on EDC](http://everydaycarry.com/posts/4428/Just-Another-Day#):

- The [Gerber Crucial Multitool](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QVMSTS?tag=09811-20) is simply the best daily carry multitool I've found yet. Yes, I've got a giant [SOG Power Lock](http://www.amazon.com/SOG-Specialty-Knives-B61-L-Serrated/dp/B003SZ0KYK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1422421779&sr=8-3&keywords=sog+power+plier+black) that I could rewire a nuclear power plant with, but the Crucial has been my daily companion for years.
- Yes, the iPhone 6+ is giant. It's everything you've always loved about the iPhone and slightly too much of it. But I love it. And the [Magpul Field Case](http://www.amazon.com/Magpul-Industries-Field-Apple-iPhone/dp/B00PXGIMSI/ref=sr_1_3?tag=everydc-20&ie=UTF8&qid=1422417465&sr=8-3&keywords=magpul+iphone+6++case) is exactly the right combination of protection, compactness, and tacticool.
- Until you carry [a flashlight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015UC17E?tag=09811-20) with you constantly, you don't realize just how often you need a flashlight.
