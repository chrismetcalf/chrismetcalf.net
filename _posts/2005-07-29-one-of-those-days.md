<p>Have you ever had one of those days when you realize that there are forces in the world that refuse to make things easy for you?<br />
<br />
... Well I just had one.<br />
<br />
I was called in earlier tonight to help get some work I did for <a href="http://www.redteamracing.org">Red Team</a> earlier this term as we get ready to deploy and test our part of the system. I had my laptop sitting on the hood of the vehicle (a robotic Humvee) while I worked and I stepped away for a moment.<br />
<br />
Just about then one of my teammates ran by to hop up on the robot to fix something and inadvertently knocked my laptop from off the hood about 5 feet to the hard concrete floor.<br />
<br />
I have less than a week before my practicum project (effectively my masters thesis) must be completed.<br />
<br />
The screen, as you can see, is absolutely destroyed. The lid is actually bent enough that it does not close without being forced.<br />
<br />
But the machine boots and the disk checks cleanly. If that's not a testament to the quality of IBM Thinkpads, I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
I'm not angry at the teammate who knocked it off. We all make mistakes. Insurance should cover its replacement (hopefully I'll get a Powerbook out of the deal). Its just an extremely inopportune time to lose full use of my laptop.</p>
