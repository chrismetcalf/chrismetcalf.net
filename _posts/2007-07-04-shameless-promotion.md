Well not quite, but close. Given the fact that I've been running various websites for nearly 8 years without a single cent in funding, I've decided to start running some rather unobtrusive Google Adsense ads at the left-hand side of the page. I know that the decision to turn a site ad-supported is not usually met without controversy. I've just come to the conclusion that I'd like my blog to be at least self-supporting. All I really want to do is cover my hosting costs. I've got a perfectly good job and I don't plan on supporting myself off of blogging (I'm amazed anybody can).
So, if you've got opinions, feel free to chime in in the comments.
