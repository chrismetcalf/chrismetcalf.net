Generally I don't post a lot of links in my main blog. Usually I just shove them over into the "Hot Links" column and hope you'll click on them yourself.

But <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/steyn/cst-edt-steyn30.html">this article</a> in the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/">Chicago Sun-Times</a> just has to be read:
<blockquote>There is something not just ridiculous but unbecoming about a hyperpower 300 million strong whose elites -- from the deranged former vice president down -- want the outcome of a war, and the fate of a nation, to hinge on one freaky jailhouse; elites who are willing to pay any price, bear any burden, as long as it's pain-free, squeaky clean and over in a week. The sheer silliness dishonors the memory of all those we're supposed to be remembering this Memorial Day.</blockquote>
Read it. And, of course, Happy Memorial Day.
