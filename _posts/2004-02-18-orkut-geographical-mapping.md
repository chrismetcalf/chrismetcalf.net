Recently I got into <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a>, Google's take on social networking. Its a lot like <a href="http://www.friendster.com">Friendster</a> with a few extra tricks under its sleeve. Some good, some bad.

Some guys at the <a href="http://www.datawhorehouse.com/">Data Whorehouse</a> (yeah, great name) came up with a pretty cool use for all that data. They've created a web application that displays <a href="http://www.datawhorehouse.com/orkut/target.php?t=1&utmz=17&utmx=275040.44274267&utmy=4683458.4518493&z=5">geographical density maps</a> of the Orkut membership. Unfortunately the data is limited to zip codes, so the nodes seem to all be clustered near local post offices. But still, a very cool use of data.
