From the message "17 Reasons Not to Slit your Wrists," on Michael Moore's email list, forwarded to me by a friend:
<blockquote><strong>7.</strong> Once again we are reminded that the buckeye is a nut, and not just any old nut -- a poisonous nut. A great nation was  felled by a poisonous nut.  May Ohio State pay dearly this Saturday when it  faces Michigan. </blockquote>
The University of Michigan plays Ohio State on <a href="http://www.mgoblue.com/calendar/calendar_display.cfm?calendar_id=6546">November 20th</a>, not November 6th. Maybe you were thinking Michigan <em>State</em>, who <em>is</em> playing Ohio State <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/schedules">this Saturday</a>. Or perhaps you got football confused with soccer, since the University of Michigan <a href="http://www.mgoblue.com/calendar/calendar_display.cfm?calendar_id=6711">men's soccer team</a> is the only UofM team playing Ohio State this weekend.
Mr. Moore, you <em>are</em> from Michigan, right? Most Michiganders don't make the mistake of confusing UofM with MSU. Thanks for the shout-out though...
