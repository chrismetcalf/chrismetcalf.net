I've been building up a good collection of awesome local micro-brews to try out, so I'm going to make a regular feature of my "beer reviews". Stick with me, since I'm hardly a veteran beer taster, and I'll be kind of learning as I go.
[Deschutes](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/) ["Hop Trip" Pale Ale](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125351.aspx) is a special-edition brew from their Bond Street series. A "Fresh Hop Pale Ale", it is brewed with "wet" Willamette Valley hops, freshly picked and added immediately to the boil.

The resulting beer is hoppier than a normal pale ale, and the fresh hop character really shows through in the final brew, yielding a beer with a bit more "guts" than an normal IPA. Those hops are balanced with malty sweet caramel flavors to make a well-rounded, very drinkable beer. The kind of beer that makes me wish I'd bought more than one bottle of it, since the chances of me finding another bottle of this limited-edition brew next time I go back to the store aren't good. 
Overall, I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10 on my still very immature beer rating scale.
