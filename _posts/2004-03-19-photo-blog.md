So I've set up a <a href="/blog/archives/category/photoblog/">photo blog</a> through some WordPress template hacking. Everything I photo blog ends up in the "PhotoBlog" category.

Right now I'm taking most of them with my Palm Zire 71. The picture quality isn't half bad for what's basically a webcam grafted to a PDA.
