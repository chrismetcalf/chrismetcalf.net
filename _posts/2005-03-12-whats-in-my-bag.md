The recent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/whatsinyourbag/">"Whats in your bag?"</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> tag caught my eye and I thought I'd play along...
My everyday bag is a Timbuk2 Commute, a great medium-sized courier bag with a cushy laptop sleeve and plenty of space. I try to avoid carrying books whenever possible in my attempt to pack lightly. Too much backpacking when I was a kid. But my 3 pound Thinkpad X31 goes with me pretty much everywhere.
