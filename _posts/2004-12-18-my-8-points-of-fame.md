You may or may not have heard, but a few days ago the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> ran a <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/8772">full page advertisement</a> for Firefox 1.0 in the New York Times. They collected donations from thousands of users, including myself.

So I got my name in the New York Times, in glorious 8-point type. Can I say I'm famous now?
