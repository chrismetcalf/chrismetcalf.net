Driving back from Albion today I heard a great interview with <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/">Mark Newman</a> on Michigan Public Radio's <a href="http://www.michiganradio.org/stateside.asp">Stateside</a> program.
He talked for awhile about his research into <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/networks/">networks of social interaction</a> and how online communities like Friendster and Orkut relate to his research.
You can <a href="http://www.michiganradio.org/ram/sside02262004.ram">listen</a> to the show via RealAudio.
