If you're between the ages of 18 and 30, and you live in a place like Seattle, there's a good chance you live in an old apartment building like I do, and there's a good chance your windows are drafty as hell in the winter.

If so, pick up a can of this stuff. "Wind Jammer" removable caulk. Its made by the same company as Loctite, and I found it at Home Depot. Comes in a convenient can so you don't even need a caulking gun (because you live in an apartment and unlike me you probably don't have one). Caulk up your windows in the winter so they're not drafty, and peel it off in the spring. Your building manager will never be the wiser, and you'll be much happier.
I've had it on my windows for the past month or so and my apartment is toasty warm now. I definitely recommend it. And I'm not being paid to say this (yet).
