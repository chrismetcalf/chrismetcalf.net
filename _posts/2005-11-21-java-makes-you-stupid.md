Java developers! This is a call to action!

Go pick up those dusty computer science "theory" books you decided to save thinking that maybe, just maybe, they might come in handy some day. Read them! Brush up on data structures, algorithms, and object oriented programming concepts. Practice big-O program analysis. Write some recursive algorithms. Review all those topics that you "forgot" because you thought you would never use them again.

I'm tired of screening Java developers who can't tell me how the internals of the libraries they use are actually implemented. When computer scientists talk about "data structures," we talk about hash tables, binary search trees, and linked lists, not java.util.Collection. We learned about program analysis in school because we were supposed to use it - if you can't tell me about the runtime implications of the algorithms you choose, then you shouldn't use them.

You got the degree, so you're obviously not stupid. Now start using what you learned.
