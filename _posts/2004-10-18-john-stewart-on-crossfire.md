I know I'm just feeding the blog frenzy on this one, but its too good not to highlight.
John Stewart was on CNN Crossfire earlier this week and although he is just as partisan as he accuses them of being, he makes some great points. You can read the <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html">transcript</a> and <a href="http://bitflood.org:8080/?file=791b2f5d95a54d1381b85f271b51f71e73964185">download a torrent</a> of the segment.
