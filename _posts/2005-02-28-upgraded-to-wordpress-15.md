A few days ago I upgraded to the new WordPress 1.5. Very nice.

Most of the changes you won't be able to see since the themeing engine and admin panel overhaul are the two biggest things. The moderation system for comments and trackbacks is much better now, great for deleting all those damn trackback spams.
