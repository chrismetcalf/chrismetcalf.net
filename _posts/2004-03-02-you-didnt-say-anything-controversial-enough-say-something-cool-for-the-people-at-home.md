Apparently 3 minutes worth of Bush-bashing by Kerry wasn't enough for CBS, so they asked him to sum it all up in a <a href="http://www.plastic.com/article.html;sid=04/03/01/01244055;cmt=22">sound bite</a>:
<blockquote>Kerry's remarks lasted three minutes, yet it left TV reporters without a soundbite until one CBS News producer asked the Massachusetts senator to try again.
"They don't know what they're talking about in their own economic policy," Kerry said of the Bush team. "Today it's one thing, tomorrow it's the next."</blockquote>
