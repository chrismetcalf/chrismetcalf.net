I was doing some googling looking for a Gmail applet for Gnome, and found the project page of the (probably dead) application "<a href="http://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub/linux/network/client/email/gmail/gmail_linuxpower_org.html">Gmail</a>" (short for "Gnome Mail"):

<blockquote cite="http://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub/linux/network/client/email/gmail/gmail_linuxpower_org.html">Gmail is an experiment in a sql vfolder based email system. It implements sql vfolders, incoming POP3, outgoing SMTP and more.</blockquote>

Hmm... SQL based VFolders. Sounds a lot like "labels" in Google's Gmail to me...

Interesting.
