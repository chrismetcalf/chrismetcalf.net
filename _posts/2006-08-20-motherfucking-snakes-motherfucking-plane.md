Tonight I had the pleasure of seeing "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_on_a_plane">Snakes on a Plane</a>"... If you haven't heard the buzz I must say it is the finest piece of cinema I've seen in a long long time.

It was a celebration of terrible cliches and hilarious one liners. A movie where you can tell they probably started with the goal of making a "real" movie, but about halfway through they realized that would never happen and said "aw fuck it, lets just make it so bad it's good." And it was so so bad, and yet so so good...
