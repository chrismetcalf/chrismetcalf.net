If you're coming to Seattle, or you live in Seattle and you haven't been yet, you <em>have</em> to check out the Seattle Downtown Library. I know, libraries don't sound that fun but the art and architecture at this one is phenomenal. I'm going to have to go back there sometime soon and spend a full day just taking pictures.
