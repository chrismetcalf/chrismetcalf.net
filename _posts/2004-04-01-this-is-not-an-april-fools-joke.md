Can somebody please explain to me why my housemate is buying baby food?

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> If you're wondering, the top one is "prunes and oatmeal" and the bottom one is "pineapple delight".

<strong class="alert">Updated Update:</strong> He says he buys it to get himself to eat fruits and vegetables he wouldn't normally eat. I still think he just bought it because he was stoned when he went to the grocery store.
