I have a confession to make...

I'm a beer snob. I've never been a big fan of lagers. Generally I've found that most of them taste the same - fairly boring, like beer I drank in college. Sure, there are occasional standouts, but nothing I've really stuck with. I'm more of an ale guy.
But <a href="http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/">Full Sail</a> has proven me wrong with their "<a href="http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/ltd.cfm?CFID=2517317&amp;CFTOKEN=97443292">LTD Series</a>" Limited Edition Lager. Just hoppy enough to be interesting, yet light and smooth enough that it goes down easy. Its reasonably priced but hard to find - I've only found it in six packs at larger Safeways and I doubt you'll find it outside the Pacific Northwest - but its a winner indeed. Something to add to the rotation whenever you can find it.
I'm going to continue reviewing good beers as I find them. Its something that makes me happy and I figure it'll be a good non-geek addition to my blog. Let me know if you enjoy it.
