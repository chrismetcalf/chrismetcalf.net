Over the past five years, I've been privileged to be part of an amazing community of technologists sharing one thing in common - a belief that broader access to APIs and the products built with them can make the technology world a better place. And it's no accident that almost all of us are friends with the same man - Kin Lane.

{% include _figure.html src="/images/posts/2016-05-23-kin-chris.jpg" caption="A rare un-bearded Kin Lane and me at API Strat in 2013" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/api-strategy-and-practice-government-and-public-open-data-panel-summary/2013/10/25" %}

Through the research posted on his [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com) blog, the [API Strategy & Practice](http://apistrat.com) conference he founded, and his leadership and evangelism at events around the world, Kin has brought together a gang of awesome people, many of whom have become my good friends. I can't thank Kin enough for being so welcoming and for helping to make me a part of this world.

Today Kin announced that he'll be taking some time off from the technology world to [spend some time in nature to help a family member in need](http://kinlane.com/2016/05/23/more-investment-is-needed-requiring-some-big-changes), and that to support that effort he'd be [putting API Evangelist up for sale](http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/23/api-evangelist-is-up-for-sale-get-your-bids-in-by-friday/). It's with a bit of sadness that we wish him the best, but he leaves behind a community that is bigger, stronger, and more passionate than it has ever been.

_Kin_ - Thank you for your kindness, your inquisitive nature, and for sharing your journey with us. We couldn't have asked for a better ambassador for the API world, and I'm glad we've been able to become friends. Best of luck in your adventure, and when you come back to the world, know you're coming back to a community that will be waiting for you with open arms.
