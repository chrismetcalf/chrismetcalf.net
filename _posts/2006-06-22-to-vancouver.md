This weekend I'll be heading up to Vancouver to race J/24's in the <a href="http://www.royalvan.com/waves/">WAVES</a> regatta. I'll be bringing my camera and I plan on trying to get some good photos when I'm not racing. Should be a good time.

Those of you who have pets and love them should give them a good hug tonight. Those that know me well and have talked to me today should know why. The rest of you should do it anyway.

<strong>Update:</strong> Suffice to say I never even took my camera out of its bag. It was a very busy but very fun weekend.
