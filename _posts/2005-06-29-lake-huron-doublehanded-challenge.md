Well, this past weekend I had the pleasure of racing in the Lake Huron Doublehanded Challenge with my father on his C&amp;C 41.

The wind was "light and variable," we spent most of the race drifting, and we didn't finish until Monday at noon, but it was an enjoyable race overall. It was nice to escape Pittsburgh and get some time on the water. Plus we got 3rd in our class.
