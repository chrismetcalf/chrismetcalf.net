Another update. This past weekend I raced in the Etchels Irish Championship at Howth Yacht Club. Great racing, great weather, and I even beat Dennis Conner in one of the races.
Now I'm doing the tourist thing in Dublin for a few days, and then I'll be going out to Galway on the west coast for a couple days. And then its back to Howth for one more regatta, the Etchells European Championship.
