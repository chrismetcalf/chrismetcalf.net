I just had to write a short post on my latest TV show addiction.

<a href="http://www.topgear.com">Top Gear</a>. I recently acquired the first season and I'm hooked! A simply awesome car show produced by the BBC. Like your standard car show they include lots of coverage of the latest supercars and luxury vehicles, but they also tend to try insane stunts like jumping over rows of motorbikes in double-decker buses.
And its all done with that special kind of wit that only the British can pull off successfully.
