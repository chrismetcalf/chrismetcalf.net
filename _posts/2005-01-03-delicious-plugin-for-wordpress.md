The dynamic links on the left-hand-side of my blog are pulled dynamically from <a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a>. This makes it easy for me to manage my link collections without cluttering up my WordPress database.
Since I think others might like to take advantage of this as well, I've packaged it up into an easy-to-use WordPress plugin.
I'm proud to announce the <a href="/wiki/index.php/DeliciousPlugin">Del.icio.us Plugin</a> for WordPress version 1.0.
<em>Update:</em> Ok so it appears I should have done some more research before going through all the work to polish up my plugin. But mine is still new and different and in my opinion, better.
