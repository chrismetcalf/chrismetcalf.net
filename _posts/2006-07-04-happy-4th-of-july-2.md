I was worried that I'd miss the fireworks since I was flying back to Seattle from San Francisco around sunset today. Oh boy was I wrong.

As we circled Tacoma in preparation for landing at SeaTac we were greeted by <em>thousands</em> of backyard fireworks celebrations as far as the eye could see.

Happy 4th of July everybody. Especially Tacoma, for making mine special.
