On the way home from the bar last night I accidentally stepped in a pothole. No big deal, right? Well, that caused a major blowout in my trusty [Rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Sandals) flip flops.

Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a bit obsessive when it comes to my flops. I insist on the best, and that's why I wear Rainbows. The drawback, however, to these excellent flops is that it takes months to properly break them in. They're like a good leather jacket - they only get better with age. Now I have to start all over...
