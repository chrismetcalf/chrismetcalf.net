An awesome time-saving database forwarded to me by a friend:
<blockquote><i>The IVR Cheat Sheet:</i> This "QuickBase" from Intuit has instructions for how to cut through
  to a real person when you call a company and get an IVR system --  Interactive (or Integrated) Voice Response. You know, the computer system that tries to solve your problem using stacked menu systems so they don't have to pay a real person to talk to you? Even though you <em>know</em> what you want can't be solved by the machine and you <em>have</em> to talk  to a human? This site will tell you what you need to do to get the human on the phone.</blockquote>
