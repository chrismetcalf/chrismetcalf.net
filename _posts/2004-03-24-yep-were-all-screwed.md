<a href="http://www.riaa.org">RIAA</a> is coming after <a href="http://www.michigandaily.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/03/24/40613af486654">nine UofM students</a> in their witch hunt for file swappers:
<blockquote>Following numerous lawsuits against Internet users suspected of file-sharing, the record industry will soon subpoena the University for the names of students allegedly sharing music illegally.
In January, the Recording Industry Association of America filed suit against 532 individuals nationwide, many of them college students. The suits, called "John Doe" lawsuits, are against users identified only by their Internet protocol addresses. RIAA is subpoenaing the University for the names of the students under its network.</blockquote>
Its a good year to not live in the dorms. I'd be so screwed.
