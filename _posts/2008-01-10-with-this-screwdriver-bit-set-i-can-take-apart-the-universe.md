Seriously, the last screwdriver bit set you will ever need. I've been looking for one of these for a long time. Besides all your standard philips, hex, Torx, and square head bits (in every imaginable size from tiny to huge) it also includes a whole ton of "security" bits, including those for secure hex, secure Torx, those crazy one-way philips-head screws you see in public bathrooms, and a few others I've never even seen before.

With this kit, I can take apart just about any piece of electronic hardware (or public bathroom urinal) I'm likely to encounter. And it was only $16 at Fry's. Definitely a must-have.
