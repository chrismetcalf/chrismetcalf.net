Latency.

Why, if I want to mail a letter to someone, do I have to mail it <em>five days</em> in advance, and I'm not even guaranteed it will get there? 

I mailed my graduation tickets home about a month ago. "USPS Priority Mail". Said it "should" be there in 2 days. It took them 4 days to deliver a one-ounce package to a city an hour away.

Seriously, get working on this.

If the USPS upgraded "First Class" mail to 2-day, guaranteed on-time delivery, I'd pay $1/ea for letter-rate stamps. Then have like "Second Class" or "Standard" mail be the regular "get-there-in-4-to-7-days-if-it-gets-there-at-all" service.
