So its been a pretty good day. Beautiful weather, nice breeze, got out on the water for the first <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~sailum/">sailing team</a> practice of the year.
And I got into Carnegie Mellon. Not the <em>exact</em> program I applied to, but  pretty close. I got into CMU's <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~msit-se/">Masters of Science in Information Technology - Software Engineering</a> (MSIT-SE) program. Looks pretty damn cool.
I think it costs twice as much as UofM's grad program because the acronym has twice as many letters.
