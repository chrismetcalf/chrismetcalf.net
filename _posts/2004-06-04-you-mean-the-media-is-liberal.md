On my way to work this morning I was listening to NPR and they had a piece on a recent Pew study on the bias of members of the media. Here's a quote from an Editor & Publisher <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000517184">article</a> on the study:

<blockquote>At national organizations (which includes print, TV and radio), the numbers break down like this: 34% liberal, 7% conservative. At local outlets: 23% liberal, 12% conservative. At Web sites: 27% call themselves liberals, 13% conservatives. </blockquote>

Is anybody really surprised by this? I'm not. I doubt the major news media will talk much about it though.

You can also read the <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/columns/column.php?columnId=2781901&wfId=1919999">NPR column</a> if you're into that.
