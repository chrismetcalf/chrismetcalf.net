Just about anybody who spends any time on the web has to admit that there are _way_ too many social networking sites. You've got [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [Myspace](http://www.myspace.com), [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com), [Friendster](http://www.friendster.com), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com), and just about [a million others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites).

Although I've had accounts on a good number of them, I just can't keep them properly updated and maintained anymore. Thus, I've decided to start "pruning my network," so to speak. As such, I've cancelled my accounts on Orkut and Friendster. I haven't even touched my Orkut account in about 2 years, except to occasionally accept friend requests from the hordes of (often quite attractive) Brazillian women who seem to try and befriend everyone on Orkut. And I hadn't logged into Friendster for so long that I couldn't remember my password. I also plan on canceling my Myspace account soon, but I'd like to notify a few friends on there before I suddenly disappear.

From now on, I plan on maintaining a much smaller collection of social sites:

* [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/) for my photo collections

* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) for general friend-networking

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismetcalf) for career networking

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/chrismetcalf) for random comments

If you want to network with me, you're best to find me on one of those four in the future.

**Update:** I've notified those people in my MySpace that weren't already on Facebook and I've canceled my account.
