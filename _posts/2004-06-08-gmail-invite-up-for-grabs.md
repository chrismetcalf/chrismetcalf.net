I just got a few more invites to <a href="http://gmail.google.com">Google Mail</a> and I've decided to give one of them away to a lucky visitor.

Leave a comment explaining why I should give you an invite. The best comment posted in the next week wins the invite.

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> GMail accounts are selling for $50 or more on <a href="http://search.ebay.com/gmail_W0QQsokeywordredirectZ1QQfromZR8">eBay</a>. You'll have to make it obvious you're not going to sell it. I'll expect a prompt email from your new GMail account. However, if nobody claims it, I'm selling it and taking the money to the bar.

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> Its now a week later and the only people to comment already have GMail accounts (I've already sent them invites). Sad, very sad.

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> I have no more invites. So stop asking.
