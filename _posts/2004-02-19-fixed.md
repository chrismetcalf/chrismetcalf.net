It appears that the wiki formatting in Internet Explorer is fixed now. It appears that IE, especially version 5, likes to ignore body width tags. I've switched to using margin tags now, which gets me about the same effect.
I've also switched from PNG graphics to GIF and JPG, again since IE sucks.
The formatting in Netscape 4 is hopelessly lost. If you're still using Netscape 4, you deserve what you get.
