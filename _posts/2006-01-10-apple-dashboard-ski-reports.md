I upgraded to OSX 10.4.4 on my Powerbook today and discovered a great new Dashboard widget... ski reports!
Unfortunately it has some sort of bug that prevents you from having more than one instance up with different reports showing. So you can only watch the reports for one mountain at a time.
Oh, and I really reall really want one of the fancy new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Apple MacBook Pro</a>. If nothing else for the awesome new magnetic power connector...
