<a href="http://99zeros.blogspot.com/">Mark Jen</a>, the Google blogger who was <a href="http://news.com.com/Google+blogger+has+left+the+building/2100-1038_3-5567863.html?tag=nl">just fired</a> for blogging about his job, is a buddy of mine from high school and college:
<blockquote> Mark Jen, a blogger whose candid comments about life on the job at Google sparked controversy last month, has left the company.
"Mark is no longer an employee at Google," a Google representative said in response to an inquiry Tuesday. Efforts to reach Jen for comment were not immediately successful.
Jen's departure comes less than a month after he joined Google as part of a wave of new hires and began recording his impressions of his new employer, including criticisms, in his blog. </blockquote>
I'm talking to him about it now. Maybe I can help shed some light on the whole situation.
<strong>Update:</strong> Mark's posted the <a href="http://99zeros.blogspot.com/2005/02/official-story-straight-from-source.html">whole story</a> in an entry on his blog.
