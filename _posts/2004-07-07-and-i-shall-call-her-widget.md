<a href="http://jbyers.com">James</a> was the big winner in the name-my-cat sweepstakes with the suggestion of "Widget". That one stuck. And even non-geeky girls think its cute.

On a side note, Widget has a nasty little kitten cold. You don't understand the true joys of pet ownership until you have a kitten with a stuffed nose sniffling directly in your ear all night because she insists on sleeping on your pillow. Its time she got acquainted with her new vet...

<strong>Note:</strong> I <em>promise</em> not to become one of those bloggers who does nothing but blog about their cat, but I felt it was necessary to post the results of the kitten-naming.
