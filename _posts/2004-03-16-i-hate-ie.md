I just thought I'd take a moment to once again talk about how much I hate Internet Explorer.

If you're going to create a monopoly, at least create a <em>standards-compliant</em> monopoly. Then I don't have to worry about your browser breaking every single bit of compliant CSS code I write. Mozilla, Firefox, and Safari play nice, why can't you?
