After getting home from a trip I took with some friends to celebrate New Years, I discovered that I'd been absolutely slammed by blog spam. In fact, up until about 10 minutes ago they were still hitting me about twice a minute. Really nasty stuff.

So I set up the <a href="http://www.gudlyf.com/index.php?p=376">AuthImage</a> plugin for WordPress to stop it once and for all. Now you have to fill out one of those annoying captcha questions every time you post a comment, but it'll at least stop the spammers.
