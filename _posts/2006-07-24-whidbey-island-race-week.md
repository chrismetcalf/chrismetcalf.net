In case anybody noticed my extended absense, I was racing in <a href="http://www.whidbey.com/raceweek/">Whidbey Island Race Week</a>, an annual regatta on an island (Whidbey Island, in fact) in northwest Washington. I was racing on a Choate 27 I often crew for named <em>Allegro Con Brio</em>. By the skin of our mathematical teeth we managed to earn ourselves a <a href="http://cycseattle.org/2006_specific/wirw.html">third in our class</a>.
I'm slowly adding photos to a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/sets/72157594209825062/">photoset</a> in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/">Flickr account</a>
