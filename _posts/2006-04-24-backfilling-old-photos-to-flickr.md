I've decided to depricate my photo gallery on chrismetcalf.net. From now on if you want to see my newest photos, Flickr is the place to be.
I'll be leaving the chrismetcalf.net gallery up at least for a while though, since it seems to drive a ton of traffic to my site. I figure its good for the Google mojo.
