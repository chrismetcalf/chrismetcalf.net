In another effort to avoid studying for a few minutes, I've added a new album of pictures I've taken around Ann Arbor with my new Nikon D100 digital SLR.
<a href="/photos/new-nikon-d100"><img src="/albums/new-nikon-d100/dsc_0083.thumb.jpg" alt="oooh pretty" /></a>
Kick ass camera, kick ass <a href="/photos/new-nikon-d100">photos</a>.
