Today I went home and picked up my new <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&grp=2&productNr=25206">Nikon D100</a> digital SLR.

All I can say is <em>"Wow!"</em> This is an incredible camera. 6.1 megapixels, full auto everything, amazing color and image sharpness. Check out the detail in the above photo. No blurring, no pixelization, none of the normal artifacts you get with a digital camera.
I couldn't be happier. Thanks mom & dad!
