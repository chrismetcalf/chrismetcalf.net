I just signed into my GMail and saw this announcement about Google's new "GMail Paper" service:

Intriguing:

<blockquote><strong>Is it free?</strong>

Yes. The cost of postage is offset with the help of relevant, targeted, unobtrusive advertisements, which will appear on the back of your Gmail Paper prints in red, bold, 36 pt Helvetica. No pop-ups, no flashy animationsâ€”these are physically impossible in the paper medium.

<strong> How about attachments?</strong>

All part of the deal. Photo attachments are printed on high-quality, glossy photo paper, and secured to your Gmail Paper with a paper clip. MP3 and WAV files will not be printed. We recommend maintaining copies of your non-paper Gmail in these cases.

<strong> Is there a limit?</strong>

You can make us print one, one thousand, or one hundred thousand of your emails. Itâ€™s whatever seems reasonable to you.

<strong>But what about the environment?</strong>

Not a problem. Gmail Paper is made out of 96% post-consumer organic soybean sputum, and thus, actually helps the environment. For every Gmail Paper we produce, the environment gets incrementally healthier.</blockquote>

I love the shot of the guy dropping off the Google box full of printouts.
