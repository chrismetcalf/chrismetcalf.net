I've just returned from my first Washington surfing adventure and, despite its best efforts, the ocean didn't manage to kill me. But I think I've caught the bug. Any sport in which beer drinking and campfire making is so integral is a winner in my book.
<strong>Update:</strong> I've also uploaded my first <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=lZ6P8LxGZbk">YouTube video</a>... a short clip of the break from this morning.
