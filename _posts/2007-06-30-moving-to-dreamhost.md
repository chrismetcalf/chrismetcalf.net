I've finally come to the conclusion that I just don't have the time or energy to manage my own dedicated host. I don't necessarily feel like fighting Apache when I get home after a long day of fighting it at work. And if you've noticed, the site has also been down a half dozen times this month.

So I'm moving my domains over to Dreamhost. I'll be trying them out for the next couple of months (they have a 97 day moneyback guarantee), and if I'm happy, I'll stick around.
__Update__: Most of my domains are now moved over to Dreamhost. So far, the experience has been very positive. There were some issues with my initial setup, but support fixed them within 15 minutes of my filing a ticket about it, which is incredible for a Saturday afternoon.
