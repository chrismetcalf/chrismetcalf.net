I had to listen to this a few times to make sure I heard Kerry right...
<blockquote>I've had one position, one <em>consistent</em> position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat, there was a right way to disarm him, and a wrong one...</blockquote>
Ok when you're done laughing, unpause your Tivo.
<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> I shit you not he just said it again:
<blockquote>I have no intention of wilting, I have never wilted in my life, and I have never wavered in my life. I know exactly what we need to in Iraq, and my position has been <em>consistent</em>. Saddam Hussein was a threat. He needed to be disarmed.</blockquote>
<strong class="alert">Another Update:</strong> Shut up already Kerry. Everybody knows you were in Vietnam. Do you want a cookie?
