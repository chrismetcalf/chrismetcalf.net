I got an excellent podcast recommendation from a coworker and I have to pass it on. Dan Carlin's ["Hardcore History"](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) series.

This is not a podcast for the casual listener. This is a podcast for the hardcore history buff or long-haul trucker with a lot of time on their hands. I'm two hours into the three hour long first episode of "Blueprint of Armageddon", a detailed history of World War I, and the Germans have just started marching to the front lines. The first three hour episode of five episodes. 15 hours just on the Great War.

And it's _fucking amazing_. Detailed, entertaining, and engrossing. I keep rewinding just to re-listen to stuff. I may go back and start from the beginning again. I wish this existed when I was still driving long distances a lot.

Try it out next time you've got a long drive or a boring night watch.
