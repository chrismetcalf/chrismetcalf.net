<a href="http://www.thelongwinters.com"><img class="wrapped" src="/uploads//wiptf_cover.jpg" alt="When I Pretend To Fall" /><a />I just got back from <a href="http://www.thelongwinters.com/index.php">The Long Winters</a> show at the <a href="http://www.blindpigmusic.com/">Blind Pig</a>.
<em>Awesome</em> show. Very much worth the $10 cover, plus the $3 service charge, and the $4 ordering charge. I ended up buying both their albums right there, so that says a lot.
I very much suggest you catch them before they get big, because these guys are good. They'll be back through town later this year.</a></a>
