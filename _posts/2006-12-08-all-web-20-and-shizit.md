So this evening, some friends and I went to check out the <a href="http://www.igniteseattle.com">Ignite Seattle</a> "unconference" up in Capitol Hill here in Seattle.

Overall, we were all incredibly impressed. The "unconference" format was excellent - short 5 minute presentations, all on very interesting topics, kept things flowing quickly and you never got bored. Plus, easy access to beer never hurts.

Some of the excellent presenters included:

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://www.realityallstarz.com/">RealityAllStarz</a> (freaking sweet, I already have an account)</li>

	<li><a href="http://biznik.com/">Biznik</a>, business social networking</li>

	<li><a href="http://darfurwall.org/">The Darfur Wall</a> (Go. Donate. Now!)</li>

	<li>Scott â€œThe Closerâ€ Ruthfield from <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, on how Amazon doesn't suck as much as you think</li>

	<li>Rob Flickenger with <a href="http://hackerfriendly.com">HackerFriendly</a>, on "book sprints" and print-on-demand</li>

</ul>

I'll be at the next one. For sure.
