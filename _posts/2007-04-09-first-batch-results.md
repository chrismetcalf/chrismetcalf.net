I know, I know. I've been bad about blogging more updates on how my homebrewing attempts have panned out.
Well, I was holding out to see how the beer turned out. I was worried I'd messed something up and would be embarassed to find out that it was ruined and my efforts were all for naut. I bottled my first batch about two weeks ago and crossed my fingers.

Well, surprise suprise, it turned out <em>excellent</em>. I'm very satisfied. And not just because I made it myself.
