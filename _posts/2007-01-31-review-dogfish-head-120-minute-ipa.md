I didn't plan on doing another beer review so quickly, but this beer has been a dream of mine for quite some time, so I figure it's worthy.
I'm back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor">Ann Arbor, MI</a> to recruit at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan">UofM</a>'s spring job fair. We decided to hit up one of my favorite local establishments, <a href="http://www.arborfood.com/columns/beer-geek/ashleys.shtml">Ashley's Pub</a>, an excellent beer bar on State Street. I had the excellent "chicken curry fries" and after dinner decided to splurge on a beer I've had my eye on for years, <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/">Dogfish Head</a>'s <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Limited_Edition_Beers/120_Minute_IPA/15/index.htm">120 Minute IPA</a>.

Whoa. What a beer. I was expecting just an extra-hoppy IPA, but I was surprised with an amazingly smooth beer with almost barleywine qualities. It has an excellent, very strong, almost fruity aroma and looks awesome in a glass. Everything about this beer is strong, yet refined, from the aroma to the flavor to the color. With over 120 IBU and 21% alcohol content, that's not surprising. Think of it as a barleywine with more "heart". The hoppyness is much more subtle, and it sneaks up on you about halfway through.
Definately a beer to drink again. It ages well, so I may pick up a few bottles to keep around for special occasions.
