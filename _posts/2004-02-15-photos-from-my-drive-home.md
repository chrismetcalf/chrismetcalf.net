These have been up for awhile, but I decided that they were quite good so I'd highlight them in my blog anyways.

My drive home from San Jose went pretty smoothly. Besides the Jeep almost crapping out, it was pretty uneventful. And I got some chances to take some great photos of the west on the way. Some of the shots from the Sierra's and Nevada are pretty damn good.

However, once I hit Nebraska it was all downhill...
