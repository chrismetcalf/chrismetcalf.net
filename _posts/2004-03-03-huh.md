Yesterday SCO said they were going to pull out the war club again and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/03/0112223&mode=thread">sue two more companies</a>.
Today they announced they were <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/03/1322244&mode=thread" >suing AutoZone</a>. An auto parts retailer. Not an ISP. Not Google. Not even a freaking IT company.
SCO has become even more of a joke to me now.
