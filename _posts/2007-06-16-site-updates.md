I couldn't sleep tonight so I made a bunch of improvements to my blog:
* Switched from using Ultimate Tag Warrior for tags to just using Wordpress' built in categories as tags. UTW broke with Wordpress 2.2. Now my `/tag/*` links work properly and things are a lot cleaner.
* A tag cloud widget in the right-hand column that actually works now.
* [Digg](http://www.digg.com) integration
* Some new plugins in the back-end you won't see.
Also of note is that I'm posting this from the [Blogging Bundle](http://macromates.com/blog/2006/blogging-from-textmate/) for my new favorite text editor, [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). Very cool.
