Just after my last <a href="/blog/archives/2004/06/08/gmail-invite-up-for-grabs/">Gmail posting</a>, Google opened up so many new invites that now just about everyone that wants one can get one. So much for selling them on eBay...

So if you want one, <a href="mailto:chris@chrismetcalf.net">email me</a> and I'll hook you up.

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> Alright already! You can stop sending me requests for invites. I'm out now. :) Didn't quite anticipate the demand...

<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> No seriously. I'm out. Stop asking.
