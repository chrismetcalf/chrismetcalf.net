So after posting a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/108439793/">few</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/108442238/">tiltshift</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/109101721/">fakes</a> to my Flickr account, the most frequent response has been "Yeah, they look cool, but what the hell is 'tilt-shift' photography??". Well let me quote myself from an email I sent to my mother as a response to just that question:
<blockquote>
Tilt/shift lenses let you change the focal plane of your camera by
shifting your lens up/down/left/right or by tilting it in any
direction. [1]
In this manner you can do lots of interesting stuff to change the
field of view and where the "focal point" is on an image. They're used
a lot in things like fashion and landscape photography to do things
like selectively bring into focus a particular part of a photo. Check
out the example fashion photo at the bottom of [2].
For landscape and in particular photos taken at a high angle of city
scenes, they have the cool side-effect of allowing you to create
pictures that look like macro photos of highly detailed models, since
you can shrink the field of view to a narrow plane of the photo a lot
like a macro lens does.
But I just fake it using a gradient mask and a lens blur in photoshop.

The whole tilt-shift miniature meme probably started with a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/27/photographer_takes_p.html">post to Boing Boing</a> with some awesome shots from a photographer who used a real tilt-shift lens to constrain his depth-of-field to make photos look like ultra-detailed models. And then, as memes go, it took on a life of its own and spawned more Boing Boing posts, Flickr groups, Photoshop "hacks", and so-on.
Ah, the joys of the intarweb...
