From the "Liquor Laws" section of the <em>Guide to Living in Pittsburgh</em> sent to me by the CMU Computer Science department:

> Beer is another story. Individual six-packs of beer must be bought from bars, and there is a limit of no more than 192 ounces of beer sold to one customer at one time. However, both bartenders and computer scientists understand the notion of iteration, and you may buy as much beer as you want as long as you carry it out in 192-ounce lots and come back empty handed each time.
