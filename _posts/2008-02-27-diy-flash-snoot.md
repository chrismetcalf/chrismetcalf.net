This one has been done a million times before, but I figured I'd write it up anyway. I also seem to have ended up [being written up in](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/02/diy_photo_snoot.html) [Make Magazine's Blog](http://blog.makezine.com), so I figured I might as well document it in my blog as well.

Basically, a snoot is a tube or channel you fit onto the end of your speedlight (flash) to create a very directed beam. They're handy for creating a tight, focused beam of light for flash photography, getting you effects similar to this one (borrowed from [PositivePaul's CC-licensed photostream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmarshphotography/)):

Mine is really the simplest of snoots - a cardboard sleeve that friction-fits onto the end of my flash. The only improvement I made to mine is the inclusion of a "grid" of corrugated cardboard you can slip in or out to change the charecteristics of the snoot:

The results are that you get a tight, extremely focused beam with the grid in place:

And a larger beam with it removed:

Simple and really easy to build out of some cardboard and gaffer's tape.
