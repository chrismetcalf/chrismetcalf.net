To prove I'm still around, I've posted a few more great albums of stuff I've taken over the last month.
<a href="/photos/to-san-jose-2004/dsc_0038"><img src="/uploads/rearview.jpg" alt="Rearview, somewhere in Wyoming" /></a>
Includes:
<ul>
	<li>More shots from <a href="/photos/flowers-and-squirrels">Ann Arbor</a>.</li>
	<li>For the stalkers, shots from <a href="/photos/uofmgrad">my graduation</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="/photos/to-san-jose-2004">Cross-country</a> from Detroit to San Jose.</li>
</ul>
Since I'm settling in in San Jose now, I should be able to post more soon.
