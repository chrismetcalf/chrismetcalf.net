Ok so I fix my problem with comment spam by forcing my commenters to jump through hoops with a captcha.
Now they've resorted to spamming my <em>TrackBacks</em>... where will it end?
Fortunately they were content hitting me with a few dozen ads for their sicko horse porn, which were easily deleted from my database.  Any creative solutions for TrackBack spam?
