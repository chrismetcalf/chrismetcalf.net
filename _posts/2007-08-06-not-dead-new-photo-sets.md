As happens way too often, a month has passed and I haven't blogged.

But I'm still around, and today I spent some time sorting out photos. I've posted two new photo sets on Flickr, one for [Whidbey Island Race Week](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/sets/72157601272603809/) and one from a recent cruise I took to [Gig Harbor](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/sets/72157601250627615/) with some friends.
