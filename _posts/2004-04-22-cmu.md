So I got to Pittsburgh this afternoon and spent a few hours walking around and exploring the university area. Very cool actually, cooler than you'd ever expect Pittsburgh to be.

You know how normal universities have stone carvings of scrolls, books, or scales of justice on their campus buildings? Yeah, CMU has one of somebody typing on a keyboard. Not that I find it all that surprising.

Oh, and there were guys out on campus handing out cigarettes for a smoke-a-thon on Earth Day. Its an obscure <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110759/">PCU</a> reference. If you knew what I was talking about you'd find that really funny.
