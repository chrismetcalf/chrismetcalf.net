You've heard of <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/flashmob.asp">flash mobs</a>, right?
Well in San Francisco on April 3rd, they're taking it to the next level... Flash Mob Supercomputing:
<blockquote>A Flash Mob supercomputer is hundreds or even thousands of computers connected together via a LAN working together as a single supercomputer. A Flash Mob computer, unlike an ordinary cluster, is temporary and organized on-the-fly for the purpose of working on a single problem. Flash Mob I is the first of it's kind. By bringing hundreds of people like you together in one room, we will have enough computing power to become one of the fastest supercomputers on the planet. </blockquote>
They're attempting to build an impromptu supercomputer from hundreds or thousands of personal computers networked and running Linux.
I think it will be more of a novelty than anything else, but  it once again brings up an interesting point. When communties come together and combine computing power, some very interesting problems could be solved. I think we'll see more of stuff like this in the future.
