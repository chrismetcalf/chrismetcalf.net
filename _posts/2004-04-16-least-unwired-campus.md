<img class="wrapped" src="/uploads//tower.jpg" alt="yep. no wires!" /><a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a> just released their list of the <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/mobiletechnology/unwiredcolleges.htm">most unwired college campuses</a>...
UofM didn't even make the top 100. We're being beaten by Western Michigan and "Harvey Mudd College". This is unacceptable!
And the founder of Intel is even a Michigan grad. You'd think they'd show us some love.
<strong class="alert">Update:</strong> A friend of mine reminded me that <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> is ranked #6. I guess I have to go there now.
