Apparently <a href="http://www.airamericaradio.com/">Air America Radio</a> launched today. Somehow the idea of listening to Al Franken and Janeane Garofalo all day long doesn't really turn me on.

Somehow his days on Comedy Central don't really let me see him as a powerful political figure. If you've got to make Liberalism funny to get people to listen to it, you've got more things to worry about.
