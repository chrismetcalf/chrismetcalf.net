It all comes down to today.

Its 3:51AM. The handoff off the official route CD happens in about 10 minutes. At sunrise, in about 2 hours, we start.

Watch <a href="http://www.redteamracing.org/index.cfm?method=page.display&amp;page=Gc05.GC05"> www.redteamracing.org</a> for real-time updates from Evan (and probably some photos from yours-truly). DARPA also has a webcast (of questionable quality) up at <a href="http://www.redteamracing.org">www.redteamracing.org</a>.
